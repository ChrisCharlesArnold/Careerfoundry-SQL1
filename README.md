Example work from my studies in the Data Analytics program. This project involved a ficticious Movie rental company called Rcokbuster. That was looking for suggestions on how to expand in the world market.
This involces work in SQL queries to organize and analyze the company data to make sense of their regional performance over time, and how they should proceed going forward.
